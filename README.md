# tripit

A very high-level abstraction library providing objects to interact with the TripIt API. It is essentially a multi-user wrapper with each object being bound to a client. This library's methodology of dealing with API data was heavily influenced by [Mike Richards' Dopplr gem](http://github.com/mikeric/dopplr).

Every object in this library mirrors the official TripIt API's properties as closely as possible. Each TripIt API object and its properties have been converted into a Ruby object. To get a list of all the objects and their properties, please see the [TripIt API XML Schema](https://api.dev.tripit.com/xsd/tripit-api-obj-v1.xsd) and the List of usable Objects below. You can also read the [TripIt API Documentation](http://github.com/tripit/api/downloads) for further details or check out the much more lightweight official [TripIt Ruby Binding](http://github.com/tripit/ruby_binding_v1)

## Install

    gem install tripit

## Usage

Here are some examples of how to use a few of the objects available. 

### TripIt::OAuth

Create a **TripIt::OAuth** instance with your consumer token and secret. Authorize the client using your access token, provided that you've already obtained one.

    client = TripIt::OAuth.new('1a2b3c4d5e', '2a3b4c5d6e')
    client.authorize_from_access('3a4b5c6d7e', '4a5b6c7d8e')
    
### TripIt::Profile

**TripIt::Profile** is used for viewing and creating objects related to the TripIt user you authenticated with **TripIt::OAuth**.

	client = TripIt::OAuth.new('1a2b3c4d5e', '2a3b4c5d6e')
	client.authorize_from_access('3a4b5c6d7e', '4a5b6c7d8e')

	# Instantiate the user by loading his profile -- pass the client object so Profile knows how to authenticate.
	myuser = TripIt::Profile.new(client)
	
	# Get the user's public display name
	myuser.public_display_name => "Test User"
	
	# Get the user's screen name
	myuser.screen_name => "test_user"
	
	# Get a list of the user's registered e-mail addresses 
	# (returns Array of TripIt::ProfileEmailAddress objects)
	myuser.profile_email_addresses => [TripIt::ProfileEmailAddress]
	
	# Get a list of the user's trips 
	# (returns Array of TripIt::Trip objects. As you use them, they will lazy-load their children.)
	myuser.trips => [TripIt::Trip]
	
	# Get a list of the user's trips, and populate all child objects in one call 
	# (returns Array of populated TripIt::Trip objects)
	myuser.trips(:include_objects => true) => [TripIt::Trip]
	
	# Check if the user is a TripIt Pro user, and then get an 
	# array of his registered TripIt::PointsProgram objects
	if myuser.is_pro?
		myuser.points_programs => [TripIt::PointsProgram]
	end

### TripIt::Trip

**TripIt::Trip** is used for viewing and creating objects related to a Trip. As previously, you must be authenticated with **TripIt::OAuth**.

	client = TripIt::OAuth.new('1a2b3c4d5e', '2a3b4c5d6e')
	client.authorize_from_access('3a4b5c6d7e', '4a5b6c7d8e')
	
	# Load a known Trip ID. If you don't know this, and are looking 
	# for a user's trips, see TripIt::Profile.trips
	trip_id = 12345678
	mytrip = TripIt::Trip.new(client, trip_id)
	
	# Get the Trip's primary location
	mytrip.primary_location => "Happy, Texas"
	
	# Get a list of nearby users (returns Array of TripIt::Profile objects)
	mytrip.closeness_matches => [TripIt::Profile]
	
	# Get the screen name of the first closeness match
	mytrip.closeness_matches.first.screen_name => "traveling_friend"
	
	# Get a list of the AirObjects for this trip 
	# (returns Array of TripIt::AirObject objects)
	mytrip.air => [TripIt::AirObject]
	
	# Get a list of segments for the trip's first TripIt::AirObject
	# (returns Array of TripIt::AirSegment objects)
	mytrip.air.first.segment => [TripIt::AirSegment]
	
	# Get some segment information for the first segment
	nyclhr = mytrip.air.first.segment.first
	nyclhr.start_city_name => "New York, NY"
	nyclhr.end_city_name => "London, United Kingdom"
	nyclhr.marketing_airline => "British Airways"

	# Get a list of Hotels for this Trip 
	# (returns Array of TripIt::LodgingObject objects)
	mytrip.lodging => [TripIt::LodgingObject]
	
	# Get some info on the first hotel stay of this trip
	hot = mytrip.lodgings.first
	hot.supplier_name => "Westin Times Square"
	hot.room_type => "Presidential Suite"
	
	# DateTime properties always return native Ruby DateTime objects
	hot.start_date_time => 2011-03-01T11:37:00+00:00
	
	# Address properties always return TripIt::Address objects
	hot.address => TripIt::Address
	hot.address.city => "New York"

## Known issues

* Currently the tests are all empty. If you can contribute, it would be much appreciated.
* Saving functionality is bare, and validation of objects for save is limited to properties. In other words, save at your own peril.

## Unofficial Library

This library is used for interaction with the TripIt API but is not endorsed or certified by TripIt. If you're looking for a more lightweight library, check out their official [Ruby Binding](http://github.com/tripit/ruby_binding_v1)
